### Description

TDD Katas in one place, possibly with minimal development stacks that allow quick start (PRs welcome)

### what do I mean by 'development stack'

This would be simply a new directory that looks similar to the `node` directory.
You would put a minimal setup to install the dependencies that let you write code and run tests against it. 
An example failing test is nice, because it gives the idea of what the workflow will look like.
If you feel like any additional comments are needed, there's always an option of creating a README.md in the stack directory :)
